# Grayangel XFCE Notification Theme
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cemozden/Grayangel/main/ss1.png)

Grayangel is a simple, efficient gradient based, XFCE notification theme.

As a person who usually struggles with default XFCE notification themes, I decided to give a shot for my own notification theme that suits my eyes better for better visibility.

## Installation
Copying the Grayangel folder to your `/usr/share/themes` folder should be doing the job. Please note that you should still activate Grayangel theme on your XFCE notification panel.
